# MENV_HRV_Dataset
# Dataset Coming Soon

We are preparing to release **[MENV_HRV_Dataset]**, a large-scale dataset collected for research on **[robust heart rate variability (HRV) estimation using mmWave radar sensing]**.

# Overview

- **Content**: Synchronized radar signals and heartbeat timestamps derived from ECG.  
  Due to privacy protection, only the ground-truth heartbeat timings are provided, not the raw ECG waveforms.

- **Applications**: [e.g., physiological monitoring, cross-domain generalization]

# Availability

Currently, the dataset is **under embargo** due to the double-blind review process of our accompanying paper.
 The dataset will be made **fully available in this repository once the paper is published**.

# Release Timeline

- **Expected release**: After paper acceptance/publication
- **Updates**: Please watch or star this repository for the latest updates

# License

 Details will be provided upon release.
